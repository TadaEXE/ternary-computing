# Ternary Computing

Ever wondered what computing would be like if it was base 3 instead of base 2?

...No?

Well, i thought so, but it's pretty interresting!

That's why I'm implementing a simulation (and maybe emulation later on) for balanced and unbalanced ternary computing, including a risc assembly language.
